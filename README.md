Business Savvy Web Developer
----------------------------
I'm a full stack turned frontend developer. I have industry experience in online publishing, E-commerce and early stage start-ups. I can start projects from scratch or build upon and tune existing deployments. I'm happy to train colleagues and I work to implement best practices sprinkled with a little culture. You can find me developing AngularJS applications, Ruby on Rails backends or busy experimenting with Bitcoin. Lastly, I am approachable for cross team communications.
