Other/Personal
--------------

High interest in various open source software projects. Including Mozilla, Ogg Vorbis, Jabber, The GIMP and Drupal. Participation in such projects includes: running and testing various versions of pre-releases (nightly builds/alpha/beta/release candidates) software; filing bug reports, tracking bug progression and offering suggestions where adequate; involvement with online discussions and offering support.

My first code contribution to open source was to the Drupal 'Image' module. With guidance from the maintainer I added a trivial [configuration option](http://drupal.org/commitlog/commit/78/be4f77d0a68424348591cde27f371253a8b755fc). Since then I have provided a [number of fixes](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commits/master?author=sime) to CakePHP core.

In the Ninth Edition of LinMagAu (November 2003), I wrote a brief article on two The GIMP (an image manipulation program) features, dynamic shortcuts and 'Autocrop'. LinMagAu was an online Australian Linux/Open Source Magazine which has since stopped publishing.

In 2007 I started competing in a beach volleyball league in Sydney and continue to play today. Since late 2009 I regularly compete in the Northern Beaches Volleyball Association tournaments which I thoroughly enjoy. In July (2010) I represented Australia in Beach Volleyball at the Croatian World Games, where athletes of Croatian heritage from around the world compete in an Olympic style event.
